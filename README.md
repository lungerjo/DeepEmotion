# DeepEmotion: Brain-agnostic 3DCNNs Learn Naturalistic Emotion from 7t fMRI

This repository contains the work of the 2024-2025 DeepEmotion project team from the University of Toronto Machine Intelligence Student Team (UTMIST).

The aim of this work is to demonstrate the utility of deep learning as signal processing on large-scale naturalistic emotion from 7t fMRI.
